## About Me

I build end-to-end analytics solutions that turn messy data into operational decisions.

My work focuses on predictive modeling, performance optimization, and translating complex analysis into clear, leadership-ready insights. I specialize in applied analytics — transforming raw data into measurable, explainable results that support real-world decision making.

Core strengths:
- Turning vague business problems into measurable models
- Data cleaning, feature engineering, and evaluation
- Predictive modeling with explainability
- Communicating technical findings to non-technical stakeholders
- Responsible analytics (bias awareness, privacy, false positives/negatives)

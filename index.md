**Data Analyst / Applied Data Science | Predictive Modeling | Dashboards**

I build end-to-end analytics projects that turn messy data into decisions — from data cleaning and feature engineering to modeling and stakeholder-ready visuals. My current focus is operational analytics (workload, risk, and performance), predictive modeling, and clear communication for non-technical audiences.

**What I want employers to know in 2 minutes:**
- I can take a problem from vague → measurable → modeled → explained in plain language.
- I’m strongest at applied work: cleaning, features, evaluation, and “so what?” storytelling.
- I care about responsible analytics (privacy, bias, false positives/negatives).

## Work / Projects
Below are portfolio projects I’m building and publishing. Each will include: problem statement, data prep, modeling approach, evaluation, visuals, and a short “stakeholder summary.”

### 1) Predicting Workout Performance & Fatigue (Wearable Data)
**Goal:** Predict fatigue risk before performance drops using wearable signals (HR, sleep, intensity, calories).  
**Methods:** Supervised ML, time-aware validation, feature engineering (rolling stats, recovery indicators).  
**Deliverables:** Model + explainability + visuals (fatigue risk over time).  
Repo: _Link coming soon_  |  Demo: _Link coming soon_

### 2) Predictive Maintenance (Sensor Data)
**Goal:** Predict equipment failure early using sensor/operational data.  
**Methods:** Classification models, feature engineering, imbalance handling, precision/recall tuning.  
**Deliverables:** Failure risk scoring + cost-aware thresholding + visuals for operations.

### 3) Immigration Case Analytics & Workload Modeling
**Goal:** Analyze processing times, workload distribution, and performance trends across service centers.  
**Methods:** Operational analytics, forecasting or workload modeling, dashboard-style reporting.  
**Deliverables:** Stakeholder story + charts + recommendations for resource allocation.

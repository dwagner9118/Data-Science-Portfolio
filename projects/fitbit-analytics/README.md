# Fitbit Performance Analytics

## Executive Summary

This project applies exploratory data analysis and multiple linear regression to wearable activity data in order to quantify drivers of calorie expenditure and identify behavioral performance patterns.

The objective was to transform passive tracking data into predictive performance insights.

## Business Problem

Wearable devices generate large volumes of behavioral data, yet most users lack structured insight into what actually drives performance changes.

This project demonstrates how predictive modeling can convert raw activity metrics into measurable, explainable outcomes.

---

## Dataset

Daily time-series activity data including:

- Total Steps
- Active Minutes
- Calories Burned

---

## Analytical Approach

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Correlation Analysis
- Feature Engineering
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Model Evaluation using R²

---

## Key Results

- Strong positive correlation between activity and calorie expenditure
- Regression model demonstrated high explanatory power
- Behavioral rhythm trends identified across time series

---

## Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-Learn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## Deliverables

- Executive presentation deck
- Regression model with evaluation metrics
- Visualizations for stakeholder communication

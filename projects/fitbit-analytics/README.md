# Fitbit Performance Analytics

## Executive Summary

This project applies exploratory data analysis and multiple linear regression to wearable activity data in order to quantify drivers of calorie expenditure.

The objective was to transform passive fitness tracking into predictive performance intelligence.

## Business Problem

Wearable devices generate high-volume behavioral data, yet most users lack structured insight into performance patterns.

This project demonstrates how predictive modeling can convert raw activity metrics into actionable decision-support insights.

---

## Dataset

Daily time-series activity data including:
- Total Steps
- Active Minutes
- Calories Burned

---

## Methods

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Correlation Analysis
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Model Evaluation using R²

---

## Key Findings

- Strong positive correlation between steps and calorie expenditure
- Active minutes significantly contribute to predictive accuracy
- Behavioral rhythm patterns identified in time-series trends
